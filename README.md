YOU CAN EASILY MAKE A REACT NEW PROJECT USING THIS 
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE 
SO HOW CAN YOU USE THAT ?
1. CLONE IT 
2. OPEN YOUR CODING TOOL
3. AND OPEN TERMINAL 
4. RUN COMMAND [ npm install, npm i ] BOTH CAN WORK
5. AFTER DONE THIS TYPE THIS COMMAND [ npm start ] 
6. BEFORE YOU START YOUR OWN CODE PLEASE REMOVE [ .git ] FILE 
7. REMOVE [ .git ] COMMAND [ rm -rf .git ] 
8. THEN YOU CAN USE AND SETUP WITH YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY TO TYPE [ git init ]
NOW YOU CAN GET SOME FOLDERS AND FILE TO USE THEN YOU CAN EASILY MANAGE
AND SETUP JUST YOUR OWN STYLE AS YOU WANT  
I HOPE THIS IS VERY HELP TO USE FOR YOU .
